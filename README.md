   Domo has the unique advantage of being the only cloud-native Business Intelligence solution to combine iPaaS (Integrated Platform as a Service) for      real-time visualizations, data integration, and predictive insights. It's ease of use also allows virtually anyone to manipulate and analyze the data    with no technical knowledge, which has been necessary for most other analytic systems. 
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the   company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
   Domo is a business cloud platform that is a SaaS and utilizes BI tools and data analytics. It is available on mobile phones through the downloaded app. Domo allows for data integration originating from anywhere (Google Analytics, cloud CRM, and even Email) which is then converted into live visualizations. Data can be added to the Domo platform through the drag-and-drop ETL accessibility. Domo allows for collaboration at every level through communication channels with visual and text messages. 

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
   The domain Domo dominates is the Software as a Service industry. 
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
   The biggest trend of SaaS is the ease of access to incredible amounts of data that is ever growing through the cloud. This allows for smaller             business customer to rapidly scale through the use of this software that they would not otherwise have access to. A continuous innovation are the       upgrades that continuously keep the software up to date "future-proofing" it. 
* What are the other major companies in this domain?
   Tableau, Microsoft power BI, Cognos, QlikTech and QlikView are the biggest competitors to Domo. 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
   The biggest business impact of Domo so far is its ability to allow everyone from the CEO to the newest employees to view the same information at the    same time from anywhere with the new mobile feature. 
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
   The biggest core metric to determine success is market share. Domo only claims .7% of the total market share with 2784 companies using their platform    but they maintain a unique disposition in the domain and are constantly growing. Another metric are the industries adopting this service and Domo        succeeds in aquiring the vast majority of their clients in the Computer Software Industry. 
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
   Although Domo takes a small percentage of the market share up, they are a new company relative to the dominators of the sector and continue to grow      and improve their service year after year. Domo also has the advantage of being the only mobile based cloud SaaS that has attracted a lot of recent      attention and business. Their biggest competitor, Tableau, only has roughly 16% of the market. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
   Just to cover all the bases I would recomend Domo adding a desktop accessibility option that currently is not offered but is by their competitors.
   
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
   This would encourage more potential companies to use their service if it is a hinderence for some businesses. 
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
   This would utilize computer software development services. 
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
   This is necessary to install Domo on computers.
